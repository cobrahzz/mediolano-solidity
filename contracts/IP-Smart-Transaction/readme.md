# Cairo Smart Transaction (Escrow) 

Develop a Cairo smart contract that allows creators and owners of digital assets to create smart transactions (escrow) for one or more assets in their portfolio. This will facilitate secure and conditional transfers of digital assets.

Example: An owner creates a condition for transferring a digital asset from their portfolio to a specific buyer. The buyer will receive the intellectual property after fulfilling the established condition, and the owner will receive the payment.

Requirements:

Conditional Transfers: Enable owners to set conditions for transferring digital assets.
Escrow Functionality: Implement an escrow mechanism to hold the assets and payment until conditions are met.
Asset Management: Allow owners to manage and view their portfolio of digital assets.
Metadata Storage: Store metadata in IPFS and link it to the assets.
Security: Ensure the contract is secure and protects both parties involved in the transaction.

Criteria:

The smart contract is written in Cairo and follows best practices for security and efficiency.
Implements functions for setting conditions and executing conditional transfers.
Escrow functionality works as expected, holding assets and payments until conditions are met.
Metadata is stored in IPFS and properly linked to the digital assets.
Comprehensive documentation is provided for the smart contract code and its usage.

Additional Information:

Refer to the ERC-721 standard documentation for details on digital asset management.
Ensure the escrow mechanism is robust and can handle various transaction conditions.
Provide detailed documentation to help developers and users understand and utilize the smart contract.
